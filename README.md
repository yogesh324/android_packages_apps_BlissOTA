# Maintainers, your ROM must be set up to include these or else it would not work properly:

1. A place to host your ROM addons to be placed into ota.xml (Default goes to http://downloads.blissroms.com/Add-ons/addons.xml but you can make your own)
3. A place to host your update info (Add it into http://downloads.blissroms.com/BlissPop/Official/modelname/ota.xml)
3. Build.prop entries (To ensure compatibility/non-compatible dialogs from showing up)

# OTA.XML Template

As of April 1st, 2015, the Bliss build code will have ota.xml support to structure it for you, as well as place it in your correct directory.

# ADDONS.XML Template

This file needs to be added into http://downloads.blissroms.com/Add-ons/, please look at http://downloads.blissroms.com/Add-ons/addons.xml on how to structure it. You can make your own. The final link will be added into the bottom of ota.xml

# BUILD.PROP Entries

If you haven't already, please merge http://review.blissroms.com:8081/#/c/78/ to get the build.prop entries "ro.ota.systemname, ro.ota.version, ro.ota.device, ro.ota.manifest"
